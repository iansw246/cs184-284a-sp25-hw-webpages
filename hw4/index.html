		<h2>Part 3: Handling collisions with other objects</h2>
		<h3>Implementation</h3>
		The cloth can intersect with spheres and planes.

		<h4>Spheres</h4>
		<p>
			For sphere intersection, each the distance from
			each point mass to each sphere's center is checked.
			If the distance less than the sphere's radius, the point mass has
			collided with the sphere.
			In this case, we calculate the tangent point on the sphere's
			surface that the point mass would have collided with if it did
			not go through the sphere. Finally, we adjust the point mass's
			position toward the tangent point scaled by friction.
		</p>
		<h4>Planes</h4>
		<p>
			Plane intersection is checked by checking for line-plane intersection
			along the line segment from the old to the new position.
			This is accomplished by solving the following equation for \(d \):
			\[
				(p - p_0) \cdot n = p_0 + (p_1 - p_0) d
			\]
			where \( p \) is a point in the plane, \( n \) is the plane's normal vector,
			and \( p_0, p_1 \) is the point mass's old and new position, respectively.
		</p>
		<p>
			If \( 0 \lt d \lt 1 \), then a collision has occurred.
			The point on the plane that the point mass would have collided with
			if it did not go through the plane is called the tangent point
			and is equal to \(p_0 + d (p_1 - p_0) \).
			To offset slightly above the plane,
			\( d - \delta \) is used instead of \( d \) for the above equation
			where \( \delta \) is a small constant.
			The vector from the old position to the new point above the plane
			is called the correction vector.
		</p>
		<p>
			Finally, the point mass's position is adjusted by correction vector
			scaled by \( 1 - f \) where \( f \) is the friction.
		</p>

		<h3>Cloth on Sphere</h3>
		A cloth in its final resting state on a sphere, with it different
		spring tension values (ks), in N/m.
		<figure>
			<img src="images/cloth-on-sphere-ks500.png">
			<figcaption>ks = 500</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<figure>

		</figure>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/cloth-on-sphere-ks50000.png">
			<figcaption>ks = 50000</figcaption>
		</figure>
		At the lowest spring tension value of 500 N/m, the cloth drapes
		vertially downward significantly and splays to the side very little.
		As the spring tension increases, the cloth hangs down less and fans
		out sideways more.

		<h2>Part 4: Handling self-collisions</h2>
		<h3>Implementation</h3>
		<p>
			To handle self-collisions efficiently, each point mass of the cloth
			is assigned to a box based on its position.
			When checking collisions, only points in the same and adjacent boxes
			must be checked.
		</p>
		<p>
			The 3D space is partitioned into 3D boxes. For a cloth with dimensions
			\( w \times h \) and \( n_w \times n_h \) points spanning the width and height,
			the box dimensions are
			\( \frac{3w}{n_w} \times \frac{3h}{n_h} \times \max(\frac{3w}{n_w}, \frac{3h}{n_h}) \).
			Each coordinate of a point mass's position is floor divided by the size of a box
			in the corresponding coordinate to get the integer coordinate of the
			box.
		</p>
		<p>
			In each simulation step, the hash table is first built.
			Then for each point, the distance from all other points in the same box
			are checked. If the distance is less than
			\(2 \ast thickness \), they are considered to have collided.
			The vector needed to move the initial point to a
			distance \(2 \ast thickness \) from the other, called the correction vector,
			is calculated. The average of all correction vectors over all
			colliding points, scaled down by the number of simulation steps,
			is the final adjustment to the point's position.
		</p>
		<p>
			The following screenshots show the progression of a
			cloth folding on itself.

		<h2>Part 5: Shaders</h2>
		<h3>Shader programs</h3>
		<p>
			A shader is an isolated GPU program used to perform rendering on
			the GPU in parallel. Two main types of shader programs are:
			<ul>
				<li>
					vertex shaders: generally operate on each vertex to transform
					properties such as position.
				</li>
				<li>
					fragment shaders: processes each fragment to calculate
					the fragment's color from  operations such as shading.
					Fragments are used to create the final colors of output pixels.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<h3>Blinn-Phong</h3>
		The Blinn-Phong shading model simulates lighting by considering three
		components that make up the reflected light from a point on a surface
		of a material: ambient, diffuse, and specular.
		The equation for the resulting lighting \( L \) from Blinn-Phong lighting is
		\( L = L_a + L_d + L_s \), which each term representing the corresponding
		component as described previously.

		<p>
			The ambient lighting component is simply a constant color added to the
			resulting lighting. This simulates light coming from all directions
			and fills in black shadows. The equation for ambient lighting \( \mathbf{L_a} \)
			is simple: For ambient lighting with intensity \( \mathbf{I_a} \) and
			an ambient constant \( k_a \), which controls the strength of ambient
			lighting relative to the other lighting terms, the equation is
			\[
				\mathbf{L_a} = k_a \mathbf{I_a}
			\]
		</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/phong-ambient-only.png">
			<figcaption>The ambient component of Blinn-Phong</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<p>
			The diffuse component represents matte reflections, which are
			reflections that don't depend on the viewing angle, only
			the angle of incoming lighting relative to the surface's normal.
			This is shown in the formula for diffuse lighting:
			\[
				\mathbf{L_d} = k_d \frac{I}{r^2} \max(0, \mathbf{n} \cdot \mathbf{l})
			\]

			Where the lighting depends on the cosine angle between the
			surface's normal vector and the vector from the given point to the light
			\( \mathbf{n} \cdot \mathbf{l} \).
		</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/phong-diffuse-only.png">
			<figcaption>The diffuse component of Blinn-Phong</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<p>
			The last component is the specular component. This represents
			direct, mirror-like reflections.

			The equation for the specular component is
			\[
				\mathbf{L_s} = k_s \frac{\mathbf{I}{r^2}} \max(0, \mathbf{n} \cdot \mathbf{h})^p
			\]

		<h3>Texture mapping</h3>
		<figure>

			<figcaption>An example of the texture mapping shader with a custom texture</figcaption>

		<h3>Bump mapping and displacement mapping</h3>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/bump-cloth.png">
			<figcaption>Bump mapping on a cloth</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/bump-sphere.png">
			<figcaption>Bump mapping on a sphere</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/displacement-sphere.png">
			<figcaption>Displacement mapping on a sphere</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<p>
			Both approaches create similar texture effects with the
			illusion of depth in the sphere's texture.
			However, displacement mapping also changes the position of the
			vertices, as is visible in the edges of the sphere.
		</p>
		<h3>Coarseness comparison</h3>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/bump-sphere-coarse-16.png">
			<figcaption>Bump mapping on a sphere with coarseness 16</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/bump-sphere-coarse-128.png">
			<figcaption>Bump mapping on a sphere with coarseness 128</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/displacement-sphere-coarse-16.png">
			<figcaption>Displacement mapping on a sphere with coarseness 16</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/displacement-sphere-coarse-128.png">
			<figcaption>Displacement mapping on a sphere with coarseness 128</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<p>
			Coarseness has little effect on bump mapping,
			but on displacement mapping, the vertices are adjusted at higher frequencies
			and the sphere has a rougher edge with increasing coarseness levels.
		</p>
